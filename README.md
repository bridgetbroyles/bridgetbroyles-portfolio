# my-portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects I've developed to expand my toolset and explore the exciting world of computer science. Each project reflects my passion for coding and problem-solving, allowing me to deepen my understanding of various concepts while having fun along the way.

In my journey, Iâ€™ve explored a variety of topics, including:

Complex logic problems, 
Graphics and visual programming, 
Game development, 
User interface design, 
Data structures and algorithms, 
Web applications, 

This portfolio is largely a work in progress, and I have yet to transfer my work from other application. However, feel free to browse through any of my projects. Thank you for visiting!
