# favorite-practiceIts

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my little collection of favorite PracticeIt problems and the solutions I came up with. 
Since PracticeIt is shutting down, I wanted to save my work and the logic behind my favorite problems before itâ€™s gone for good.
That way I can review my work from my Freshman year at UT Austin for future tests and special cases. 

Note: All problems are sourced from PracticeIt by the University of Washington.
Some solutions were created with references to tutorials and textbook answers to help guide my understanding.
