# Freshman Year Projects

This folder contains practice code and mini-projects I've completed during my freshman year in Computer Science at UT Austin. 
Some files are practice programs that I wrote on course material and others are simply projects or files I made for fun.

### Relative Work from CS312 at UT is included, but all information complies with UTs honor code
